# CS422 - Candy Crush
This is a basic, text version of the game candy crush. Written in vanilla JavaScript, this projects concentration was on responsive and intuitive User Interface design. In the future I plan to update the text with images of the candies themselves.

# What It Looks Like

# Play Candy Crush!
To play, first click on the New Game button, then enter the letter and number of the square you want to move. The arrow buttons will light up if there is a valid move that will crush 3+ candies. To execute the crush, press the Crush Once button, rinse, and repeat!
